Hello, this is the final project for MGSC 662 - Decision Analytics course from McGill University. I worked on this project with Jules Zielinski, Ram Babu and Alfonso Cabello.
For this project we used Pulp, an optimisation library from Python, to perform linear optimisation on the total revenue of the company.
