# United
United Management Fleet

Hello, this is the final project for MGSC 662 - Decision Analytics course from McGill University. I worked on this project with Jules Zielinski, Ram Babu and Alfonso Cabello.
For this project we used Pulp, an optimisation library from Python, to perform linear optimisation on the total revenue of the company.
For more information, please refer to "MGSC_662_Project_Report_Team5" and the Jupyter notebook "Project_United.ipynb".
The stochastic model is called "Project_United_Stochastic.ipynb".
Note that all the data is on the Jupyter notebook.
